Welcome to the Unreal Engine Angelscript documentation! This section provides everything you need to get started with Angelscript in Unreal Engine.

### Available Guides

- [Installation](/getting-started/installation/) - Learn how to set up Angelscript for your Unreal Engine projects
- [Scripting Introduction](/getting-started/introduction/) - A tutorial that introduces you to creating your first Angelscript actor

### What is Angelscript?

Angelscript is a high-level scripting language that integrates with Unreal Engine. It provides:

- Fast iteration cycles with immediate code reloading
- A C++-like syntax that's familiar to Unreal developers
- Better performance than Blueprints
- Simplified setup compared to C++
- Seamless integration with both C++ and Blueprints

### Who is it for?

Angelscript bridges the gap between designers using Blueprints and programmers using C++. It's ideal for:

- Technical designers who find Blueprints limiting but don't want to use C++
- Programmers who want faster iteration times than C++ provides
- Small teams who need to be more efficient in their development workflow
- Anyone who wants better performance than Blueprints with the convenience of a scripting language
