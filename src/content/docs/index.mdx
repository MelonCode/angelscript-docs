# Unreal Engine Angelscript

UnrealEngine-Angelscript is actively developed by [Hazelight](http://hazelight.se), creators of [It Takes Two](https://www.ea.com/games/it-takes-two), which was shipped with the majority of its gameplay written in angelscript. More recently, [The Talos Principle 2](https://www.thetalosprinciple.com/) was also shipped by [Croteam](http://www.croteam.com/) using UnrealEngine-Angelscript.

The unreal plugin that integrates angelscript is open source, and has received contributions from studios in Stockholm and globally.

## Mission Statement

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Avoid Blueprint Spaghetti" icon="warning">
    When making gameplay systems of higher complexity, blueprint visual
    scripting can easily lead to unmaintainable spaghetti.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fast Iteration" icon="rocket">
    Scripts can be reloaded instantly in the editor, letting developers focus on
    creating cool shit instead of waiting for compiles and editor restarts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Improved Cooperation" icon="puzzle">
    Because programmers and designers are no longer separated by the
    C++/Blueprint divide, they can work closely together using the same systems
    and tools.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Performance" icon="approve-check">
    Angelscript performs significantly better than blueprint for game scripting,
    and approaches native C++ performance when using transpiled scripts in a
    shipping build.
  </Card>

## Features

### Familiar but Simplified

![Code example](/img/scripting.png)

Programmers used to working in Unreal C++ will find the scripts instantly familiar, but with many key simplifications to make life easier for designers and avoid common C++ pitfalls.

### Script Hotreload for Fast Iteration

See your changes to scripted actors and components reflected immediately when you hit save.

Non-structural changes can be reloaded _while_ playing your game for lightning-fast iteration.

### Scripting with Full Editor Support

To make scripting easier, a [Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Hazelight.unreal-angelscript) is available implementing full Language Server Protocol support.

This includes support for many editor features, such as:

- Code Autocompletion
- Error Diagnostics
- Rename Symbol
- Find All References
- Semantic Highlighting

### Integration with existing C++ and Blueprint workflows

Angelscript classes can override any BlueprintImplementableEvent you expose from C++, and can be used seamlessly as base classes for child blueprints.

Use whatever combination of tools fits your workflow best.

### Debugging Support Through Visual Studio Code

Debug your script code through the Visual Studio Code extension. Set breakpoints and inspect variables, and step through your scripts to find issues.
