# Unreal Engine Angelscript Documentation

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro + Starlight project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
